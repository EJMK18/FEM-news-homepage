## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

The navigation menu was the greatest challenge for this project. Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) and CSS properties and values were briefly introduced to complete this navigation menu. Utilising CSS grid for the layout proved a bit challenging as well. Smaller CSS grid and flexbox components as grid items create new challenges regarding alignment of the grid items. However, it also created new posibilities for better CSS grid layout designs.

### Continued development

I am well aware that I still have a long way to go to learn the fundamentals of HTML, CSS and JS. However, being introduced to ARIA, I would like to explore these sets of roles and attributes to create an accessible rich experience for my projects to come.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) - This introduced me to some of the ARIA attributes, which aided with the JS code implemented.
